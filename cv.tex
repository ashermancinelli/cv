\section{Research \\ Interests}

I am interested in low-level code optimization, concurrency, distributed systems, and systems programming.
My current focuses include:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Smooth and sustainable ports of CPU-bound HPC codes to GPUs.
  \item Software development best practices.
  \item Concurrent and distributed design patterns.
  \item Performance tuning.
\end{itemize}

\section{Professional \\ Experience}

\subsection{Pacific Northwest National Laboratory}[Richland, WA USA]
\begin{positions}
  \entry{ExaSGD Software Development Thrust Lead}{April 2020~--~Present}
  \entry{HPC Software Developer}{June 2019~--~March 2020}
  \entry{Machine Learning/HPC Software Developer}{June 2018~--~June 2019}
\end{positions}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Received PNNL's Outstanding Performance award twice: once for performance on ExaSGD with the Exascale Computing Project, and another for optimizing a biological simulation code expanded upon below.
  \item Led development team to port high-performance linear solver \hiop to run on GPUs from several several vendors (AMD, NVIDIA).
  \item Led several team-wide hackathons of up to $\approx 40$ members of 5 national laboratories to port ExaSGD software stack components to GPU.
  \item Reimplemented and refactored parts of NIH protein-folding codebase with 30,000+ users worldwide (can be found \href{https://github.com/Electrostatics/apbs}{\underline{on its github repo}})
  \item Received recognition and accolades for optimization work on several projects as a part of Research Computing :
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Increased performance of a biological simulation by $\approx 2,500\%$ (from 2 weeks to 8 minutes) by developing an \mpi aware \cpp codebase and interfacing with the original Python-based research code.
    \item Increased performance of an LED simulation by $\approx 15,000\%$ (from 6 weeks to 4 minutes) by porting \matlab codebase to \cee and \cpp. I developed a parallel implementation of roughly the same algorithm using device-local shared memory and distributed memory via \mpi.
    \item Optimization work described as \textit{the posterchild for how PNNL should operate} by a panel of external collaborators.
    \item Developed new implementation for an \mpigv call using tree-based reduction algorithm.
  \end{itemize}
  \item Reproduced closed-source research with a sequence-to-sequence neural network for OCR (\textit{Rosetta} network).
  \item Led training sessions on code optimization and HPC techniques at PNNL.
  \item Gave talks about optimizing research code and developing inter-language interfaces to be performant.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Micron Technologies}[Washington D.C. Metro Area]
\begin{positions}
  \entry{Data Science \& Analytics Intern}{June 2017~--~August 2017}
\end{positions}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Invented algorithm to cluster wafer defects increasing company profit by significant margin.
  \item Wrote statistical regression model to filter large amounts of financial data which increased bargaining power of procurement department.
  \item Developed time-series model to predict server failure that decreased server downtime.
\end{itemize}
